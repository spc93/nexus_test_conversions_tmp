# nexus_test_conversions_tmp

Real and hacked I16 NeXus files; Jupyter notebook to demonstrate some simple workflows such as creating of legacy files.
780431.nxs is a real (quite old) I16 NeXus file
815893.nxs has been hacked to illustrate some workflows supported by the NXclassic_scan application definition

Click on the Binder icon to start a JupyterHub instance. Click on the Jupyter notebook file (test_classic_scan_conversions_binder_demo) and run notebook (restart kernel and run notebook).

Note: It takes a few minutes for the launch the VM.

Note: You can't break this as the container imgage is created from scatch each time.

Look at the output in the notebook and also the three legacy-format files created.

Note: this is not an example of the final file layout required, but contains key aspects of it and demonstrates some required workflows (also just demos - not the final solution).
